This code adds a few new possibilities of how to use the FP2 DIY-shield. 
It adds full control of the LEDs, the Neopixel and the temperature sensor.
Furthermore this enhances your FP2 with a small IR-controller, which can be used to manage e.g. an LED-strip with IR-reciever.
In this example the HEX-codes for the IR-remote are hardcoded in the Arduino-Code (not in the App) and are designed for using it
with devices that apply the HEC-protocoll.

To upload the sketch to your extension itÂ´s the best to use the App ArduinoDroid, which is available in the PlayStore.
